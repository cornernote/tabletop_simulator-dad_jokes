# Endless Dad Jokes

![Thumbnail](./workshop/thumbnail.jpg)

Ever wished your tabletop sessions came with a steady supply of eye-rolls and groans?  
This bag delivers exactly that: every time you pull a notecard from the bag, it fetches a fresh *dad joke* straight from
the internet and writes it onto the card.

No repeats, no setup needed – just terrible puns on demand.
